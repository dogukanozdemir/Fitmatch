3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Start the services** (in separate terminals or use your IDE)
   
   Start services in this order:
   
   ```bash
   # 1. Discovery Service (Eureka Server)
   cd discovery && mvn spring-boot:run
   
   # 2. User Service
   cd user && mvn spring-boot:run
   
   # 3. Events Service
   cd events && mvn spring-boot:run
   
   # 4. API Gateway
   cd gateway && mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Verify the services are running**
   - Discovery Server: http://localhost:8761
   - User Service: http://localhost:8090
   - Events Service: http://localhost:8888
   - API Gateway: http://localhost:8222

## üîß Development

### Project Structure

```
fitmatch/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common/              # Shared DTOs, enums, and utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ discovery/           # Eureka Discovery Server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events/              # Events microservice
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gateway/             # API Gateway
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user/                # User management and authentication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml   # Database containers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pom.xml             # Parent POM
```

### Code Quality

The project uses **Spotless** with Google Java Format for consistent code formatting:

```bash
# Check code formatting
mvn spotless:check

# Apply code formatting
mvn spotless:apply
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run tests for specific service
cd user && mvn test
```

### Database Schema

The application uses automatic schema generation via Hibernate's `ddl-auto: update` configuration. The spatial data is handled using PostGIS extensions for location-based queries.

### Adding New Features

1. Follow the existing microservice pattern
2. Use the `common` module for shared components
3. Implement proper error handling and validation
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Update API documentation
